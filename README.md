# OJIP-PQredox

**Python scipts analysing OJIP data to determine the VJ parameter as a semi-quantitative measure for PQ-redox.** 

The accompanying paper *Assessing the redox state of the plastoquinone pool in algae and cyanobacteria via OJIP fluorescence: limits and perspectives* is currently in the publishing process.

Each analysis described in the manuscript is provided as a separate Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and can be executed locally to repeat the analyses.

## Installation

To clone the repository and install a  `conda` environment, please follow these instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Computational-Biology-Aachen/OJIP-PQredox.git
cd OJIP-PQredox
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To execute the analysis notebooks, the measured experimental data will need to be placed in the `data` folder. Please contact the authors for access to the data.
